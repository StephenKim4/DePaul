    "The results of getting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the matrix in project 3 are above. I read that a steady-state vector of a regular Markov chain is an eigenvector for the transition matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue 1, so that would be the 1st Eigenvalue and Eigenvector. The 2nd eigenvalue and eigenvector doesn't really make sense because they have negative numbers. The eigenvector corresponding to Î»1 holds the values 0.7621968742 and 0.6473452904, which represent the steady-state vectore, meaning the approximate final vector reached if the Markov chain is run infinite number of times. The two numbers also directly correlate to the project 3 results of the vector [54.07396169, 45.92603831], which was reached after running the Markov chain 10 times. The ratio of the eigevector values and the project 3 vector results show that the higher value is ~1.1774 times larger than the lower value. This shows that the eigenvector represents the steady-sate vector of the Markov chain. So the Eigenvector shows that if the total percentage is 141 and the vector values are normalized to represent a total percentage of 100%, then the total number of cars that end up in city A is 54.074% and the percent of cars that end up in city B is 45.926%. \n"
